# Covid-19 Tableau Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed Covid-19 data between the year 2020 - 2022 and built an interactive dashboard summarizing key metrics and trends.

The goal of this project it to showcase my data visualization skills using Tableau.

In this Tableau dashboard, I showcase how to:
1) Build different graphs to depict key data metrics
2) Use color, size, and position as a pre-attentive attribute to draw users attention to key insights
3) Develop an interactive dashboard displaying key trends and patterns

Refer to the "Covid-19 Dashboard.twbx" file to view and interact with the Tableau dashboard
